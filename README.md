# Basic Chat Application!

## Overview

I wanted to build a simple slack clone / chat application without tutorial to practice spinning up Express backends and React frontends. The main goal here was to implement Socket.io for real time chat updates. I architected the application in it's entirety and worked out all aspects of the implementation based on my current knowledge and what seemed practical based on the scope layed out in the Socket.io documentation.

### Backend

Express - simple backend architecture

### Frontend

### Installation
